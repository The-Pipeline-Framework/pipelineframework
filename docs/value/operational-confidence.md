## At a Glance

<div class="value-glance">
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Container First</strong>Works naturally with Kubernetes-style deployment models.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Operational Metadata</strong>Generated metadata clarifies what is running and how.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Resilience Patterns</strong>Consistent DLQ, error handling, health, and observability practices.</div>
</div>
