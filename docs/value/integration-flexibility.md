# Transport Choice

<p class="value-lead">TPF keeps pipeline behavior separate from transport wiring, so APIs can evolve without rewriting core flow logic.</p>

## At a Glance

<div class="value-glance">
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>One Model, Many Surfaces</strong>Generate gRPC, REST, and local clients from the same definition.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Domain First</strong>Transport details stay in generated adapters.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Function Ready</strong>Function-platform support where it adds value.</div>
</div>

## Use This When

- Different clients need different protocols.
- You are migrating interfaces and need to avoid big-bang rewrites.
- Contract consistency across transports has become a pain point.
