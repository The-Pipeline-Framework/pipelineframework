# Performance

<p class="value-lead">TPF is tuned for high-volume step processing where throughput and stability matter day to day.</p>

## At a Glance

<div class="value-glance">
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>High Throughput</strong> &middot; Reactive flow handles concurrency without thread-per-request bottlenecks.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Predictable Runtime</strong> &middot; Generated paths reduce hidden runtime wiring.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Quarkus Foundation</strong> &middot; Keep Quarkus startup, container, and runtime strengths.</div>
</div>

## Use This When

- Infrastructure cost is rising as traffic grows.
- You need faster startup and tighter runtime footprint.
- Performance tuning is blocked by opaque framework behavior.
