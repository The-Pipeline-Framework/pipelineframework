# Operators: Business Value

Operators let teams integrate proven business logic into TPF pipelines without rewriting it.

## Why It Matters

- Faster delivery: reuse existing Java compute logic directly from `pipeline.yaml`.
- Lower migration risk: bring legacy or domain-hardened logic into TPF incrementally.
- Better ROI: preserve prior engineering investment while adopting platform governance.
- Portfolio leverage: one pipeline model can orchestrate logic from multiple teams and modules.

## Executive View

With operators, TPF becomes a practical integration layer for enterprise logic already in production.  
This reduces transformation cost and shortens time-to-value for pipeline modernization programs.

## Strategic Direction

- Current scope: Java operators resolved at build time (no runtime reflection).
- Planned direction: remote and polyglot operator execution paths, still governed by TPF contracts.
