# Plugins, Not Glue

<p class="value-lead">TPF gives teams structured extension points so cross-cutting needs do not leak into business flow code.</p>

## At a Glance

<div class="value-glance">
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Clean Extensions</strong>Implement persistence, caching, and other cross-cutting concerns as plugins.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Consistent Wiring</strong>Generated adapters keep behavior aligned across roles and transports.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Strong Platform Base</strong>Quarkus runtime and tooling stay available underneath TPF.</div>
</div>

## Use This When

- Platform features keep duplicating across teams.
- Core services are getting polluted with infrastructure logic.
- You need shared extension patterns with predictable behavior.
