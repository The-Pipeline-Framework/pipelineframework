# Observability Overview

Observability in The Pipeline Framework is designed for distributed pipelines: you should be able to see what each step did, how long it took, and where failures occurred.

## What You Get Out of the Box

1. **Metrics**: Step timings, throughput, and failure counts
2. **Tracing**: End-to-end request visibility across steps
3. **Logging**: Structured logs with correlation identifiers
4. **Health Checks**: Liveness/readiness for orchestration
5. **Alerting**: Dashboards and alert rules tuned for pipeline behavior
