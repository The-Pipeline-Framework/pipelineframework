# Orchestrator Runtime

The orchestrator runtime coordinates step execution for a pipeline and exposes generated transport entrypoints.

## Runtime Modes

TPF supports two orchestrator runtime modes:

1. `SYNC` (default): in-process request/response execution.
2. `QUEUE_ASYNC`: queue-driven async job execution with durable execution state providers.

Set mode with:

```properties
pipeline.orchestrator.mode=SYNC
# or
pipeline.orchestrator.mode=QUEUE_ASYNC
```

## Transport Surfaces

Generated orchestrator endpoints are transport-native:

1. REST:
   - `POST /pipeline/run`
   - `POST /pipeline/run-async`
   - `GET /pipeline/executions/{executionId}`
   - `GET /pipeline/executions/{executionId}/result`
   - `POST /pipeline/ingest`
   - `GET /pipeline/subscribe`
2. gRPC:
   - `Run`
   - `RunAsync`
   - `GetExecutionStatus`
   - `GetExecutionResult`
   - `Ingest`
   - `Subscribe`
3. Function/Lambda:
   - `PipelineRunFunctionHandler`
   - `PipelineRunAsyncFunctionHandler`
   - `PipelineExecutionStatusFunctionHandler`
   - `PipelineExecutionResultFunctionHandler`

## Queue-Async Semantics

In `QUEUE_ASYNC` mode:

1. committed execution state transitions are exactly-once (OCC/conditional-write guarded),
2. dispatch and operator invocation are at-least-once,
3. duplicate invocation can occur and must be handled with idempotency keys,
4. streaming outputs are rejected for async execution in this milestone,
5. persisted protobuf payload metadata stores `_tpf_message` as the protobuf schema full name.

## Queue-Async Control Plane

Runtime provider choices:

1. `ExecutionStateStore`: `memory` (dev), `dynamo` (durable).
2. `WorkDispatcher`: `event` (in-process), `sqs` (durable queue).
3. `DeadLetterPublisher`: `log` (built-in fallback), `sqs` (durable DLQ).

Failure channel split:

1. Execution-level terminal failures use orchestrator DLQ (`DeadLetterPublisher`).
2. Step-level recover-and-continue failures use Item Reject Sink (`pipeline.item-reject.*`, `rejectItem` / `rejectStream`).

Execution lifecycle (one transition per worker claim):

```text
Submit(run-async)
  -> createOrGetExecution (dedupe key + execution row)
  -> enqueue work item
  -> worker claimLease (OCC + lease expiry)
  -> execute transition
  -> commit transition (markSucceeded / scheduleRetry / markTerminalFailure)
  -> enqueue next transition OR finalize terminal state
```

Recovery points:

1. crash before commit: queue redelivery replays the transition.
2. crash after commit before next enqueue: due sweeper re-dispatches.
3. worker death while leased: lease expiry allows takeover.

These guarantees are deterministic for orchestrator state, not for external side effects; downstream step boundaries must accept at-least-once invocation.

## Queue-Async HA Baseline

Use this as a minimum production baseline for queue-driven HA:

```properties
pipeline.orchestrator.mode=QUEUE_ASYNC
pipeline.orchestrator.state-provider=dynamo
pipeline.orchestrator.dispatcher-provider=sqs
pipeline.orchestrator.dlq-provider=sqs
pipeline.orchestrator.queue-url=https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/tpf-work
pipeline.orchestrator.dlq-url=https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/tpf-dlq
pipeline.orchestrator.idempotency-policy=CLIENT_KEY_REQUIRED
pipeline.orchestrator.strict-startup=true
```

Operational expectations for this baseline:

1. state transitions remain OCC-guarded and lease-claimed,
2. queue delivery and operator invocation remain at-least-once,
3. terminal dead-letter events are durable, not process-local log-only.

CI confidence for this baseline:

1. `SYNC` remains the default runtime mode and the fast baseline configuration.
2. `QUEUE_ASYNC` remains opt-in and requires explicit durable provider configuration.
3. the durable HA gate exercises the checkout `deliver-order` recovery path against `dynamo` + `sqs` semantics with `DynamoDB Local` + `ElasticMQ`.
4. this gate covers:
   - worker kill takeover,
   - sweeper redispatch,
   - duplicate submit determinism,
   - durable DLQ publication.
