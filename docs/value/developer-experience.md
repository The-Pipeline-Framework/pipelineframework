# Developer Joy

<p class="value-lead">TPF removes the repetitive parts of delivery so teams can focus on business behavior instead of plumbing.</p>

## At a Glance

<div class="value-glance">
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Start Fast</strong> &middot; Design in Canvas and generate a runnable baseline.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Type Safety</strong> &middot; Shared `common` contracts catch drift at build time.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Less Boilerplate</strong> &middot; Adapters and client layers are generated for you.</div>
</div>

## Use This When

- You want new developers productive quickly.
- Refactors are becoming risky because contracts drift across modules.
- Teams are spending too much time on integration wiring.

## Operator Reuse

When teams already have stable Java compute libraries, operators let them plug those methods directly into pipeline flow from `pipeline.yaml`.
This shortens delivery time and avoids duplicate implementations.
