# Start Monolith, Split Later

<p class="value-lead">The Pipeline Framework (TPF) supports a practical architecture path: start with one deployable unit, then split when team and scale pressure make it worth it.</p>

## At a Glance

<div class="value-glance">
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Fast First Release</strong> &middot; Monolith layout helps teams move quickly at the start.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>Clear Migration Path</strong> &middot; Shift to pipeline-runtime or modular layouts as boundaries mature.</div>
  <div class="value-glance-item"><strong>No Core Rewrite</strong> &middot; Change topology without rebuilding pipeline behavior.</div>
</div>

## Use This When

- You need speed now but know service boundaries will evolve.
- Team ownership is outgrowing a single deployable unit.
- Architecture discussions are stalling delivery.
